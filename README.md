What is the Labyrinth?
---
Labyrinth is the matching Paper Plugin written in Java for the Labyrinth Community Project on our Survival Server.
Its whole purpose at the moment is to create a zone where mobs can't spawn so that players don't need to light up the whole labyrinth

### About Mobspawning
On our server there is no lighting below / above, and we don't want mobs to spawn there, also Bats are friendly but
Only spawn in caves or when Minecraft thinks we are in a cave, so we don't want to let them spawn too.
